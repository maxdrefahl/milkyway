# Milkyway Simulation
 
A simulation of planetary motion. 
Takes input from a .txt file including names of orbiting objects, the object it is orbiting, and data concerning its mass and eccentricity of orbit. 
These planetary objects are plotted in a 2d window where their motion is tracked.
The last and next button allow the user to cycle between available planets to choose as the center of the screen.
The scroll feature allows the user to zoom in and out of the solar system.
The slider at the bottom of the window allows the user to adjust the speed at which the simulation runs.
The Toggle Parent Lines button toggles lines drawn from every object to the parent it is orbiting.
The Toggle Tracers button toggles tracers drawn behind the planets mapping out their orbit.
